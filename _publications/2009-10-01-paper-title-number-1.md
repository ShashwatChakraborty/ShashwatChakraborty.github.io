excerpt: 'Analyzed, interpreted, and recreated results of a paper on the application of the Replicator Equations in studying nonlinear behaviour and Bifurcation Theory for biological co-evolution of three species. Simulated the nonlinear Phase Space behaviour of the three co-evolving species populations using numerical methods to solve the replicator equations (differential equations) and plotted it using Python.'

Analyzed, interpreted, and recreated results of a paper on the application of the Replicator Equations in studying nonlinear behaviour and Bifurcation Theory for biological co-evolution of three species. Simulated the nonlinear Phase Space behaviour of the three co-evolving species populations using numerical methods to solve the replicator equations (differential equations) and plotted it using Python.
