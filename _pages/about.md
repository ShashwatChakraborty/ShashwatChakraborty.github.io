Hello there! I'm Devashish, a third year undergraduate student at IIT Bombay doing a B.Tech in Engineering Physics with Honors in Physics. Altough I am interested in physics and mathematics in general, I am particularly interested in two broad fields; Quantum Computing and Cosmology.

I am interested in the design and implementation of Spin Qubits in solid state quantum systems. So far, my experience in
Quantum Computing has been inclined towards instrumentation involved in measurement and data acquisition.
I am also interested in Cosmology, especially Models of Inflation trying to explain how the early expansion of the universe
led to the formation of structure as well as the homogeneity on large scales.
