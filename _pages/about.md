I'm Devashish, a third year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay doing a B.Tech in Engineering Physics with Honors in Physics. I am fascinated by physics and mathematics in general but I am particularly interested in two broad fields: Quantum Computing and Cosmology. Apart from academics I enjoy playing Squash and sketching in my free time. 

If you want to have a look at my CV click [here](https://devashish-shah.github.io/files/CV_Devashish_Shah.pdf). You can find the list of courses I have taken [here](https://devashish-shah.github.io/academics/) and the list of my projects [here](https://devashish-shah.github.io/projects/).
