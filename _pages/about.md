I'm Devashish, and this page is a short introduction about me. Currently, I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/en/about-iit-bombay), pursuing a B.Tech in [Engineering Physics](https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/en/curriculum-btech) with Honors. I enjoy reading about and studying physics and mathematics, but my interests revolve around two broad fields of physics: Quantum Computing and Cosmology. For more about my research interests, go [here](https://devashish-shah.github.io/research/). Apart from academics, I like playing sports, especially squash and football, and I like sketching whenever I can find the time.
