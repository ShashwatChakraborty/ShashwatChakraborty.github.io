<p>To a large extent, my interests revolve around two broad fields; Quantum Computing and Cosmology.
  <ul>
  <li> I am interested in the design and implementation of Spin Qubits in solid state quantum systems. So far, my experience in
  Quantum Computing has been inclined towards instrumentation involved in measurement and data acquisition. </li>
  <li> I am also interested in Cosmology, especially Models of Inflation trying to explain how the early expansion of the universe
    led to the formation of structure as well as the homogeneity on large scales. </li>
</ul> </p>

<p>I am actively working on projects related to both these fields. Click <a href="https://devashish-shah.github.io/projects/">here</a> for more details.</p>
