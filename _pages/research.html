<p>I am a theoretical condensed matter physics (CMP) enthusiast. The following subfields of CMP interest me the most:</p>
<ul>
<li> Quantum Transport: </li>
	<ul>
	<li> Transport phenomena in conductors have been studied for decades. We are all taught the Ohm's law in high school which governs the 
	transport of charge carriers in a diffusive conductor. But when the length of the channel (for carrier transport) is reduced to a scale
	comparable to the carrier mean-free path, the Drude model breaks down and things start to get interesting. These conductors are called ballistic conductors.
	The two popular approaches to model ballistic transport are:
		<u>
			<li> 
			Boltzmann Transport Equation (Semi-Classical)
			</li>
			<li>
			Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) 
			</li>		
		</u>
	I work on the latter. <a href="https://nanohub.org/courses/FON1">Here</a> is an awesome resource to learn more about NEGF. 
	</li>
	</ul>
<li> First Principles Methods</a>: </li>
	 <ul>

		 The philosophy behind first-principles approaches, in general, is that we want to start with the fundamental 
		 (Schrodinger equation) and go all in to solve it numerically to model quantum systems and make prediction. But 
		 it's not as straightforward as it seems at first glance. Exactly solvability of the Schrodinger equation is lost 
		 beyond hydrogen, making approximations inevitable. This is where Density functional Theory (DFT) comes into play!
		 If you are interested in learning more about DFT, you can refer to 
		 <a href = "https://www.amazon.in/Computational-Physics-J-M-Thijssen/dp/0521575885">this</a> book.
