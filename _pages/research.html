<p> I enjoy studying physics, mathematics, and electronics in general, but to a large extent, my interests revolve around two broad fields of physics:
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">Quantum Computing, Sensing and Transport</a>: </li>
	<ul>
	<li>
	The experimental side of Quantum Computing, especially quantum control and measurement, is incredibly intriguing. Apart from the interesting aspect of fabricating and physically realizing qubits, one gets to design and use ingenious measurement techniques to take advantage of 
   	fascinating quantum transport and sensing phenomena.
	</li>
        <li>
	Along with experimental QC, I would like to explore related fields like Quantum Materials and Quantum Optics. 
	</li>
	<li>
	My practical experience in Quantum Computing has been inclined toward instrumentation involved in measurement and data acquisition. I am 
	currently working on a project involving understanding the functioning of and then automating instruments used for quantum control of spin qubits. 
	You can find the details of this project <a href="https://devashish-shah.github.io/projects/">here</a>.
	</li>
	</ul>
<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)">Inflationary Cosmology</a>: </li>
	 <ul>
	 <li>
	 Ever since I started learning General Relativity, I have been fascinated by the simple and intuitive physical notions it is based upon, despite the fact 
   	 that it has one of the most difficult nonlinear mathematical frameworks in physics. On the other hand, I think that the rather non-intuitive theory 
   	 of Quantum mechanics is compensated for by the 'simpler' linear nature of the theory. Catering to my Interests in both these fields, I am currently studying 
	 Cosmic Inflation.
	 </li>
	 <li>
	 I am working on a research project studying the different Models of Inflation which explain how Quantum Fluctuations in the very early and
	 near-homogeneous universe grew to form the large-scale structure we see today. It tries to answer the question, "what caused the universe to look like
	 it does today?". You can find more details about this project <a href="https://devashish-shah.github.io/projects/">here</a>.
