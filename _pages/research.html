<p>To a large extent, my interests revolve around two broad fields:
  <ul>
  <li> Quantum Computing: 
    <ul>
      <li>
      I am slightly more inclined toward the experimental side of Quantum Computing, especially quantum control and measurement. I was especially fascinated
      by the physics, behind Coulomb Diamond excited state spectroscopy of single Quantum Dots, and I like reading about unique topologies used to realize
      "good quality" Spin Qubits.

      <li>
      My practical experience in Quantum Computing has been inclined toward instrumentation involved in measurement and data acquisition. I am 
      currently working on a project involving understanding the functioning of and then automating instruments that will be used for Qubit control.

      <li> Inflationary Cosmology: 
    <ul>
      <li>
      Ever since I started learning General Relativity, I have been fascinated by the simple, intuitive physical notions it is based upon, despite the fact that
      it is perhaps the most difficult nonlinear mathematical theory of physics. On the other hand, I think that the rather non-intuitive theory of Quantum 
      mechanics is compensated for by the pleasant linear nature of the theory. Catering to my Interests in both these fields, I am currently studying 
      Cosmic Inflation.

      <li>
      I am working on a research project studying the different Models of Inflation which explain how quantum fluctuations in the very early and
      near homogeneous universe grew to form the large-scale structure we see today. It tries to answer the question of, "what caused the universe to look like
      it does today?". You can find more details about this project <a href="https://devashish-shah.github.io/projects/">here</a>.
