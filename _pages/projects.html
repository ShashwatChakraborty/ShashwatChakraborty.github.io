<p>Here is a list of a few key projects I have undertaken during my Undergraduate studies. You can find the relevant reports and codes on my <a href="https://github.com/ShashwatChakraborty?tab=repositories">
    GitHub</a> page.</p>
<h1>First Principles Calculation of Spin Spectra of Magnetic Systems </h1> <p align="left">(May’23-Present)</p>
<p> Mentor: Prof. Marco Bernardi, Caltech <br></p>
<ul> 
<li> Developed a code for computing <b>magnon dispersions</b> of materials with magnetic order 
using <b>Linear Spin Wave Theory </b> (LSWT)</li>
 
<li>Performed <b>Density Functional Theoretic</b> (DFT) calculations to obtain electronic bandstructure, density of states (DOS), 
    and phonon-dispersion of various materials using <b>Quantum Espresso </b>. </li>
 
<li>Learned and employed the <b>Perturbo</b> code
    developed by the Bernardi Research Group to compute <b>electron-phonon matrix elements </b>.</li> 
<li>
    Calculated the <b>optical</b> (excitonic) and <b>magnetic</b> (magnonic) excitations of 2D ferromagnetic and 
    antiferromagnetic materials using <b>YAMBO</b> code after a detailed literature survey on <b>Many-Body Perturbation Theory</b> (MBPT).
</li>    
</ul>

<h1>Topological Electronics and Antiferromagnetic Spintronics | Bachelor's Thesis Project </h1> <p align="left">(May '22 - Present) </p>
<p> Guide: Prof. Bhaskaran Muralidharan, IIT Bombay <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Studied the realization of topolgically non-trivial states in <b>Su-Schrieffer-Heeger</b> (SSH) chain and
    <b>graphene</b>.</li>
 
<li>Analyzed quantum transport properties of 1D chain, 2D rectangular lattice and graphene <b>tight-binding</b> (TB) models after conducting a thorough literature survey on time-dependent <b>Keldysh</b> formalism based on 
    <b>Non-Equilibrium Green's Function</b> (NEGF) method for nanoscale conductors under bias.  </li>
 
 <li>Performed NEGF based modelling of <b>Magnetic Tunnel Junction</b> (MTJ) devices and 
     <b>Spin-Transfer Torque</b> (STT) based Ferromagnetic memory devices.</li>
 <li> Developed a code to compute the STT and numerically model the magnetization dynamics using the coupled
     <b>Antiferromagnetic Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert</b> (AF-LLG) equations.</li>
</ul>

<p> Guide: Prof. Hridis Pal, IIT Bombay <br></p>
<ul>
    <li>Modeled a superconductor-vacuum junction using the <b>Bogoliubov de-Gennes</b> (BdG) theory for tight-binding models 
        and calculated variations in superconducting <b>critical temperature</b>.</li>
 
<li>Developing a code to calculate the <b>order parameter</b> configuration in superconductor-topological 
    insulator heterostructures using the <b>Fu-Kane model</b> Hamiltonian. </li>
<li>The project aims to mathematically model the boundary superconductivity exhibited by <b>Weyl materials</b>.</li>

</ul>
 
<h1>Feedback-assisted Quantum Annealing for Portfolio Optimization| Quantum Hackathon </h1> <p align="left">(Aug’22-Dec'22) </p>
<p> Guide: Prof. Siddhartha Santra, IIT Bombay <br></p>
<ul>
<li>The project aims to obtain more reliable and optimal solutions from <b>quantum processors</b> with quantum speedup for portfolio optimization.</li>
 
<li>Worked on a <b>hybrid quantum-classical algorithm</b> that provides statistically calibrated feedback to the quantum subroutine.</li>
