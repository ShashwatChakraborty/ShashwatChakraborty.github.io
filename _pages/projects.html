<h1>RF Pulse Engineering </h1> <p align="left">(Jun’22-Present)</p>
<p> Guide: Prof. Suddhasatta Mahapatra, IIT Bombay <br>
QCoDeS is an open source Python-based data acquisition framework developed by the Copenhagen/ Delft/ Sydney/
Microsoft quantum computing consortium, made to facilitate measurements in nanoelectronics.
 
• Developing drivers using QCoDeS to control an Arbitrary Waveform Generator, a Vector Signal Generator, and associ-
ated equipment to engineer Radio Frequency pulses for quantum control of spin qubits.
 
• Studied sensing and measurement techniques used for quantum control of spin qubits in Quantum-Dots fabricated in
Silicon hetero-structures at the Silicon Quantum Computing (QSi) lab at IIT Bombay.
 
• Built an Analog circuit using Op-Amps that mimics the current {ISD(VG1, VG2)} map through a Single Electron Transistor
capacitively coupled to two plunger gates on a larger voltage scale. </p>

<h1>Models of Inflation | Research Project </h1> <p align="left">(Nov’21-Present) </p>
<p> Guide: Prof. Vikram Rentala, IIT Bombay <br>
• Research project studying the different Models of Inflation which explain how quantum fluctuations in the very early,
near homogeneous universe grew to form the large scale structure we see today.
 
• Current focus of the project is on studying Cosmological Inflation and re-deriving results from the T.A.S.I. (Theo-
retical Advanced Study Institute) lectures on Cosmology by Daniel Baumann (Jul 2009).
 
• Read up on all relevant topics in General Relativity and Physical Cosmology with Spacetime and Geometry (by
Sean Carroll) and Modern Cosmology (by Scott Dodelson) as the primary reference books. </p>
