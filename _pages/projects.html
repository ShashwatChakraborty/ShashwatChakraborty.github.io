<p>Here is a list of a few key projects I have undertaken during my Undergraduate studies. You can find the relevant reports and codes on my <a href="https://github.com/Devashish-Shah?tab=repositories">
    GitHub</a> page.</p>
<h1>RF Pulse Engineering </h1> <p align="left">(Jun’22-Present)</p>
<p> Guide: Prof. Suddhasatta Mahapatra, IIT Bombay <br>
    QCoDeS is an open-source Python-based data acquisition framework developed by the Copenhagen/ Delft/ Sydney/
    Microsoft quantum computing consortium, made to facilitate measurements in nanoelectronics.</p>
<ul> 
<li> Developing drivers using QCoDeS to control an Arbitrary Waveform Generator, a Vector Signal Generator, and associated equipment to engineer Radio Frequency pulses for quantum control of spin qubits.</li>
 
<li>Studied sensing and measurement techniques used for quantum control of spin qubits in Quantum-Dots fabricated in
Silicon hetero-structures at the Silicon Quantum Computing (QSi) lab at IIT Bombay.</li>
 
<li>Built an Analog circuit using Op-Amps that mimics the current {ISD(VG1, VG2)} map through a Single Electron Transistor
capacitively coupled to two plunger gates on a larger voltage scale.</li> 
</ul>
<p> Apart from the QCoDeS project, I am currently reading up on the physical principle behind dilution refrigerators and the working of 
    superconducting electromagnets, which are key for low-temperature electron spin qubit control. </p>

<h1>Quantum Effects in Inflation | Research Project </h1> <p align="left">(Nov’21-Present) </p>
<p> Guide: Prof. Vikram Rentala, IIT Bombay <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Research project studying the different Models of Inflation which explain how quantum fluctuations in the very early,
 near homogeneous universe grew to form the large-scale structure we see today.</li>
 
<li>Current focus of the project is on studying Cosmological Inflation and re-deriving results from the T.A.S.I. (Theoretical Advanced Study Institute) lectures on Cosmology by Daniel Baumann (Jul 2009).</li>
 
 <li>Read up on all relevant topics in General Relativity and Physical Cosmology with Spacetime and Geometry (by
 Sean Carroll) and Modern Cosmology (by Scott Dodelson) as the primary reference books.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Spintronic Quantum Computing Architecture | Research Project </h1> <p align="left">(Dec’22-Present) </p>
<p> Guide: Prof. Ashwin Tulapurkar, IIT Bombay <br></p>
<ul>
    <li>Studying manipulation of a chain of qubits embedded in a coherent channel using spin-torque.</li>
 
<li>Studying if the above architecture can be used to execute quantum algorithms with any advantage over the conventional approach relying on magnetic fields to control qubits. </li>

</ul>
 
<h1>Optical Parametric Oscillation in Topological Insulators | Course Project </h1> <p align="left">(Aug’22-Nov'22) </p>
<p> Prof. Anshuman Kumar, IIT Bombay | PH421: Photonics <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Studied selective lazing of edge modes in 1D and 2D SHH (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger) chains and the advantages offered in this case, like, robustness against disorders.</li>
 
<li>Used Quitp (python) to simulate the Eigen energies, band diagram, effects of coupling disorders, and squeezed states in the quantum regime for 1D and 2D SHH chains.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Arduino to Simulate Ideal Gases | Techfest, Techconnect </h1> <p align="left">(Dec’22-Jan'23) </p>
<p> Guide: Prof. Pradeep Sarin  <br>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Created a physical setup to electronically simulate a simplified version of the microscopic motion of ideal gases using Arduino, an LED matrix, and other electronic components. </li>

<ul>
<li>Analyzed and interpreted data consisting of 4 million observations of high energy (Center of Mass Energy ∼13 T eV) proton-proton collisions generated using PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator.
 </li>
 <li>Studied the relationship between net-charge fluctuation and multiplicity by analyzing and plotting statistical
parameters (like mean, std. deviation, etc) related to net-charge fluctuations using ROOT - Cern data analysis
software.</li>

studying nonlinear behaviour and Bifurcation Theory for biological co-evolution of three species.
 </li>
 <li>Simulated the nonlinear Phase Space behaviour of the three co-evolving species populations using numerical
methods to solve the replicator equations (differential equations) and plotted them using Python.</li>
