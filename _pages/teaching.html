<h1> Teaching Assistant </h1>
<p> I have fulfilled the duty of being a Teaching Assistant (TA) for junior year students for their core courses. As a TA I conducted weekly tutorial sessions 
  for a batch ot 45 students to discuss problem sets and course content related doubts. Apart form this, as a TA I evaluated quizzes of students 
  taking the course and provided course-work related guidance whenever needed. </p> 
<p>So far I have been a TA for two courses:</p>
<ul>
  <li><h2><a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/acadpublic/crsedetail.jsp?ccd=PH%20107">Quantum Physics and Application (PH107)</a></h4></li>
  <li><h2><a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/acadpublic/crsedetail.jsp?ccd=PH%20108">Basics of Electricity and Magnetism (PH108)</a></h4></li>
</ul>
