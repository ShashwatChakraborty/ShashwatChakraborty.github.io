<h1> Teaching Assistant </h1>
<p> I have been a Teaching Assistant (TA) for first and second year students in their core courses. </p>
 <p> As a TA for theory courses, I conducted weekly tutorial sessions for a batch of 45 students to discuss problem sets and course content related doubts. 
  Apart from this, I evaluated quizzes of students taking the course and provided course-work related guidance whenever needed. I enjoy being a TA since it 
   is a not only a great opportunity to help fellow students with courses, but also allows engaging discussions that often lead me to rethink topics in newer, 
better ways to ensure that an idea is understood.</p> 
<p>So far I have been a TA for two theory courses:</p>
<ul>
  <li><h2><a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/acadpublic/crsedetail.jsp?ccd=PH%20107">Quantum Physics and Application (PH107)</a></h4></li>
  <li><h2><a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/acadpublic/crsedetail.jsp?ccd=PH%20108">Basics of Electricity and Magnetism (PH108)</a></h4></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the notes I made for my tutorials <a href="https://github.com/Devashish-Shah/PH_107">here</a>.</p>
<p> I am currently a TA for the <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/acadpublic/crsedetail.jsp?ccd=PH%20230">Digital Electronics</a> lab course in the physics department. 
  As a part of my TA duty, I help students with their weekly labs which involve building electronic circuits based on digital logic.
